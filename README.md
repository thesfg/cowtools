Cow_Tools_Utility_0.1 is a file prongling tool that is somewhat 
lacking in sophistication for Linux. It reads the binary data of a file and displays 
the values into "MOOlean" output, meaning it converts "1" to "m" and "0" to "o". It is non-destructive, does not have a 
save feature, and does not alter the files or system in any way. 

This is a simple homage I made to The Far Side Comic "Cow Tools" by Gary Larson. 
I am not affiliated with The Far Side nor Gary Larson, this is a fan-made work.  

-------------
To install, clone this repo and add it to your PATH in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

    export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/cowtools"

Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

To start "Cow_Tools_Utility" type 'moo' on the command line.

You must be in the directory of the file for 'moo' to work.
