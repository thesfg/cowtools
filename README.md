Cow_Tools_Utility_v0.1 is a file prongling tool that is somewhat 
lacking in sophistication for Linux. It reads the binary data of a file and displays 
the values into "MOOlean" output, meaning it converts "0" to "M" and "1" to "0". It is non-destructive, does not have a 
save feature, and does not alter the files or system in any way. 

This is a simple homage I made to The Far Side Comic "Cow Tools" by Gary Larson. 
I am not affiliated with The Far Side nor Gary Larson, this is a fan-made work.
